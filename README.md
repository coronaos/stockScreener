# stockScreener

  Hi everyone,
  
  This is a script that scans almost the 500 stocks from S&P (hardcoded srry), then it gets from the Yahoo Finance API the Opening Price of the previous week and the Closing Price of it.

  You have to use it at Mondays, unless you change the two variables "start_date" and "finalle_date".
  
  It calculates if the stock went down 5%, if it has gone down, it prints the symbol of the stock and the percentage.
  
  This idea has come from a Reel of instagram, a guy explains a HFT strategy and I wanted to try it.
  
  First buy is CMG.US (Chipotle) ayayyay cabronesss at $57.23 with a 7% down from the last week. daaang.
  Netflix is too 5% down, concretely a 6%.
  
  kisses to everyone
